Heavy soil, likely to create drainage problems and unsatisfactory root development.
Engineering The cultivation of the soil (ploughing) should be the minimum possible and is done when the soil has the appropriate moisture (is in the plow) to achieve improvement
Recommendation: ventilation and drainage. The use of a Ripper is recommended. It can be improved by surface addition of river sand or perlite
The pH is appropriate for the cultivation of Cotton
The pH is high and is likely to create problems of micronutrient (especially iron) and phosphorus deficiencies. Nitrogen should be applied in acidic
pH : form. Preventatively, the application of foliar sprays containing trace elements (especially Fe and Zn) and phosphorus is useful.
Electric Very low
Conductivity: salinity Possible occurrence of nutrient deficiencies. Poor soil with little microbial activity
Possible creation of a hard layer in the subsoil. Low availability of P and Trace Elements. Low moisture retention capacity

AgroEco 240436 Zannias 3D. OBSERVATIONS & COMMENTS
It is recommended not to install plants that require acidic soil e.g. Blackberries, Blueberries etc.
It is recommended not to install plants that are not favored by high Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3)
After periods of plant stress due to low temperatures, drought, hail etc. It is recommended to use a biostimulant at the stage
of comb formation and during flowering. Dosage 0.3L per hectare with a spray solution quantity greater than 20 L per Acre
REQUIREMENTS OF CULTIVATION IN SOIL & CLIMATE
Cotton is a plant with great adaptability and can be grown in a wide variety of soils. High yields are achieved in
medium mechanical texture, deep fertile soils with adequate drainage with good water content and organic matter < 3.0%. On light soils
requires increased amounts of fertilizers while heavy soils that are waterlogged cause suffocation and diseases in the root system and are
unsuitable for cultivation. Shows good tolerance to soil salinity. As for acidity, it grows in a wide pH range
from 5.5 to 8.0, medium from 6.8-7.3. It is a plant of warm climates, with special requirements in high temperatures during the growth period and
after sowing, the minimum soil temperature for satisfactory germination is 13°C, while the optimum temperature
environment for rapid growth and high yields is 32°C - 34°C
BASIC PRINCIPLES OF LUBRICATION
Basic fertilization (in the seed): Seeks to meet the needs in nutrients that are necessary for the good establishment of the plants, the
creation of a rich root system and the early and robust growth of the vegetation.
of Phosphorus (the lack of Phosphorus in the first stages of cultivation is not corrected later), the entire amount of Potassium and up to
50% of the amount of Nitrogen (it is recommended to use ammonium fertilizers, slow release).
Surface fertilization (combs): The surface fertilization seeks to meet the needs of nutrients that are necessary for
development of summer vegetation, flowering and fruiting, as well as nut development. It is recommended to be applied by
the beginning of the appearance of the lines until the beginning of flowering in a dose (stabilized forms of Ammonia Nitrogen) or more
doses (through hydrofertilization with Nitrate forms of Nitrogen). The remaining amount of Nitrogen (50%) is administered.
IRRIGATION
According to the analysis data, the soil at 0-30 cm weighs 346.88 tons
The maximum amount of water that can hold the ground is: 125.09 sq.m. the acre
The active root layer depth of the crop where the main mass of plant roots develop and the main is formed
supplying the roots with water is: 65 - 130 cm.
The total water requirements of cotton average around 700 km per hectare per year. From germination to the appearance of combs
Recommended irrigation method: STAGDIN
TREATMENT OF THE SOIL
The mechanical treatment of the soil must be done when its moisture is at 50-60% of its water capacity.
LUBRICATION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS
- The application of the basic fertilization, in the winter period, should not be done in periods of frost.
- The application of surface lubrication, in the summer, should not be done during hot hours.
- For the correct application of hydrofertilization, the fertilizer is channeled into the middle third "set" of the irrigation system (If you have scheduled 12-hour irrigation
turn on irrigation from 4 to 8 o'clock)
- The foliar sprays of trace elements can be combined with a dilute solution of urea (0.2-0.3%) for better penetration into the interior
leaves as well as neutralizing the free acidity of the solution with lime water. In case you prepare mixtures yourself
micronutrients, use only chelated forms and not sulfated forms. Solutions should be prepared immediately before
application. It is recommended to perform a compatibility test before each use.
- For the application of foliar fertilizers:
- Do not do it in hot weather and the spray solution should wash the leaf from both sides.
- Spray in cold and wet periods of the twenty-four hours (at night or early morning).
- Never spray stressed plants.
- Do not spray when the trees or crop is in distress or a general weakness.
- Particular care must be taken so that the pH of the spray liquid varies between 5.5 and 6.5
- Application should be done evenly, covering the foliage as much as possible on both sides
- The effectiveness of fertilization is usually increased when the fertilizer is administered in several small doses, with the maximum amount of
is granted in the period when the maximum need for cultivation is observed. In this direction, frequent irrigation and
small doses.
The fertilizers proposed are for basic types on the market and not for products of specific companies.
The present advisory fertilization of a plot of land is based on the laboratory results of the sample provided and
referred to in this certificate and is indicative of the general culture referred to. Adjustments may be required due to
parameters of age, cultivation, method of installation, climatic conditions or other parameters that may
concern the specific plot of land.
Re-testing of the soil in three years is recommended
